# Choose Your Own Adventure style game for Engineering Ethics
This is an edited digital adaptation of Fiegel, Rundlett, Bradley, and Murhammer's 2021 Choose Your Own Adventure activity.

## Mechanics
This game requires decisions to made with limited information.  Several times throughout this activity there are also opportunities to experience unfolding events outside of your control.  These events are marked by the "Outside Influence (random event)" header.  The results of these events are determined semi-randomly in accord with the probabilities initially assigned by Fiegel, Rundlett, Bradley, and Murhammer (2021).
